READ THIS BEFORE YOU TRY TESTING THE PROGRAM

This program uses SHA256 encryption method, it also imports the Fernet symmetric encryption library. So you need to make sure these two libraries are installed
on your system and that they're functioning properly. 

This program is not meant to be 100% accurate with the coordination system, it uses NASA's Galactic Coordinate System and simulates the Milky Way galaxy, generates a random raw coordinate within that
blank space of galaxy and then goes through a process of conversions to use as a password and security for encrypting files.

IMPORTANT: 
  Make sure you edit the 44th line of code that incorporates the file path of a file on your system to an actual file. Otherwise it will run into a runtime exception error.
